How to Use?
1. Firstly, you need to log in to your Instagram account.
2. On the right side, you can see your username database that will be used for tagging. Add here any username you want to tag.
3. After logging in, you can create a new comment action by clicking "Create New Comments". The app will, then, require you to enter the Instagram URL for the competition post, as well as how many times you want to comment, number of tags per comment, and the waiting time between each comment.
4. Once click on "Run" button, you can see live event log for commenting.


New Features

2. Now, the app lets you enter waiting time as seconds between comments.
